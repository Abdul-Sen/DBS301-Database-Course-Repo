# DBS301-Database-Course-Repo

DBS301 is a 3rd semester database course where we work with Oracle SQL Developer 12c to solve everyday database problems (creating reports, views, joins, sequences, indexes, synonyms etc..). We work with DDL, DML ,DCL in this course. We also get to design databases based on business needs through ERDs and then implement them in Oracle.
